Description: The packages introduces a collection of LC-MS/MS datasets
            obtained on Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes at different times
            of their lifespan. The discovery of proteins differentially abundant
            between the young and old ages was performed using spectral counting
            approach. Interrogation of the common biological functions of the
            proteins with altered abundance revealed up-regulation of
            DNA/RNA-related pathways (e.g. cell cycle and mRNA splicing)
            and down-regulation of metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis and
            glyconeogenesis)

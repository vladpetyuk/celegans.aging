Description: The packages introduces a collection of LC-MS/MS datasets
            obtained on Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes at different times
            of their lifespan. The discovery of differentially abundant proteins
            was performed using spectral counting approach. Interrogation of
            common biological functions of the proteins with altered abundance
            revealed up-regulation of DNA/RNA-related pathways and
            down-regulation of metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis and
            glyconeogenesis)
